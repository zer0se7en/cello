## Introduction
Using Cello, everyone can easily:

* Build up a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform quickly from scratch.
* Provision customizable Blockchains instantly, e.g., a Hyperledger fabric network v1.0.
* Maintain a pool of running blockchain networks on top of baremetals, Virtual Clouds (e.g., virtual machines, vsphere Clouds), Container clusters (e.g., Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes).
* Check the system status, adjust the chain numbers, scale resources... through dashboards.

A typical usage scenario is illustrated as:

![Typical Scenario](docs/images/scenario.png)

## Quick Start

Environmental preparation:

1. docker [how install](https://get.docker.com)
2. docker-compose [how install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. make `all script for cello service management is written in Makefile`
4. kubernetes (`optional`) [how install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

If environment is prepared, then we can start cello service.

* Build essential images for cello service (Optional, because currently the dockerhub image auto build haven't ready, in the future you can ignore this step.)

```bash
# make docker
```

* config variables for service deployment through menuconfig/alldefconfig, then will generate .config file under the project folder.

if you want to use default configuration for service deployment, only need run alldefconfig.

```bash
# make alldefconfig
```

if you want to set the config through terminal ui, run menuconfig ![menuconfig](docs/images/menuconfig.png).

```bash
# make menuconfig
```

* Start cello service, default deployment method is using docker-compose, if you have kubernetes environment,
you can change deployment method to kubernetes through `DEPLOY_METHOD=k8s make start`.

```bash
# make start
```

After service started up, if use docker-compose method, you can see output:

```bash

```

If use kubernetes method to deploy, the output is:

```bash
NAME                                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

If you visit the dashboard through 8081 port, the default username/password is `admin/pass`.

* Stop cello service, same as start, need set the `DEPLOY_METHOD` variable.

```bash
# make stop
```


## Main Features
* Manage the lifecycle of blockchains, e.g., create/start/stop/delete/keep health automatically.
* Support customized (e.g., size, consensus) blockchains request, currently we mainly support [Hyperledger fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric).
* Support native Docker host, swarm or Kubernetes as the worker nodes. More supports on the way.
* Support heterogeneous architecture, e.g., X86, POWER and Z, from bare-metal servers to virtual machines.
* Extend with monitor, log, health and analytics features by employing additional components.

## Documentation, Getting Started and Develop Guideline
For new users, it is highly recommended to read the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) or [index](docs/index.md) first.

And feel free to visit the [online documentation](http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information. You can also run `make doc` to start a local documentation website (Listen at [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Why named Cello?
Can you find anyone better at playing chains? :)
